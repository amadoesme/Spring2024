/* Names: Esmeralda Amado
 * Course: CS2011
 * Section: 09 & 10
 * Description: Nibble monster ask's how many
 snacks the user has. Once it reaches to three
 snacks it serves the user a salad and tells
 them how many monster made. The program continues
 till the loop ends.
 * Other comments: It took me a long time to 
 undertand the hints and what exactly i had to do.
 I'm no longer sure if my code looks messy or not.
